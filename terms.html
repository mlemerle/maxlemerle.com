    <h1>Terms & Concepts</h1>
    <p>A collection of useful terms, concepts, and phrases from finance, economics, and social investment.</p>

    <h2>Finance & Economics</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Minsky Moment</strong></dt>
      <dd>A sudden collapse of asset values that reverses the perceived safety of borrowing, triggering a rapid transition from a stable period of growth to financial crisis. Named after economist Hyman Minsky. Often occurs when speculative borrowing becomes unsustainable.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Moral Hazard</strong></dt>
      <dd>A situation where one party takes on risk because they don't bear the full consequences of that risk. Example: banks taking excessive risk knowing they'll be bailed out by government.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Adverse Selection</strong></dt>
      <dd>A market condition where sellers have more information about quality than buyers, leading to a disproportionate number of lower-quality goods being traded. Results in market breakdown or only high-price transactions surviving.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Regulatory Arbitrage</strong></dt>
      <dd>The practice of exploiting differences in regulations across jurisdictions to reduce costs or increase profits. Example: locating operations in areas with lighter regulation.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Rent-Seeking</strong></dt>
      <dd>The pursuit of economic gain through manipulation of the social or political environment rather than through productive economic activity. Example: lobbying for monopolistic privileges rather than innovating products.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Principal-Agent Problem</strong></dt>
      <dd>A conflict of interest arising when an agent (e.g., CEO) acts on behalf of a principal (e.g., shareholders), but the agent has incentives that diverge from the principal's interests.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Carry Trade</strong></dt>
      <dd>Borrowing in a low-interest currency and investing in a higher-yielding asset, pocketing the interest rate differential. Creates leverage risk if the investment falls in value.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Convexity</strong></dt>
      <dd>A measure of the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and yields. Positive convexity means the price gains from falling yields exceed the price losses from rising yields.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Tail Risk</strong></dt>
      <dd>The probability of extreme events that fall at the tails of a probability distribution. Often underpriced by markets until it realizes.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Mark-to-Market</strong></dt>
      <dd>Valuing an asset based on its current market price rather than historical cost or intrinsic value. Can amplify volatility in crises when market prices collapse.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Negative Carry</strong></dt>
      <dd>A situation where the cost of holding an asset exceeds the income generated from it. Often done strategically to maintain a position during favorable future conditions.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Basis Risk</strong></dt>
      <dd>The risk that the financial instrument used to hedge an asset doesn't move in perfect correlation with the asset, leaving residual exposure.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Disintermediation</strong></dt>
      <dd>The process of removing intermediaries from a transaction, allowing parties to transact directly. Can disrupt traditional financial institutions.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Stealth Wealth / Conspicuous Frugality</strong></dt>
      <dd>Behavior of wealthy individuals who avoid displaying their wealth through consumer goods. Often associated with more sophisticated investors.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Social Investment & Impact</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Social Impact Bond (SIB)</strong></dt>
      <dd>A financial instrument where private capital funds interventions addressing social problems, and government repays the investment plus a return if outcomes improve beyond a threshold.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Outcomes-Based Contracting</strong></dt>
      <dd>A procurement model where payment is tied to achieving specific, measurable social outcomes rather than delivering a service or input.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Additionality</strong></dt>
      <dd>In social impact, the concept that an intervention produces outcomes that wouldn't have occurred without that specific investment. Central to measuring social impact.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Deadweight Loss</strong></dt>
      <dd>Economic inefficiency that occurs when equilibrium is not achieved. In social programs, refers to outcomes that would have happened anyway without intervention.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Crowding Out</strong></dt>
      <dd>When government or philanthropic spending on a social problem reduces private or individual response. Example: welfare reducing private charity.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Counterfactual</strong></dt>
      <dd>In impact measurement, what would have happened in the absence of an intervention. Estimating the counterfactual is key to measuring true impact.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Theory of Change</strong></dt>
      <dd>A conceptual map linking inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact in a logical sequence. Shows how and why change is expected to occur.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Blended Finance</strong></dt>
      <dd>The strategic use of public, private, and philanthropic capital to address social or environmental challenges. Lower-risk capital "absorbs" some risk to attract market-rate capital.</dd>

      <dt><strong>ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)</strong></dt>
      <dd>Non-financial factors considered when evaluating corporate performance and societal impact. Increasingly integrated into investment decisions.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Social Return on Investment (SROI)</strong></dt>
      <dd>A framework for quantifying the social value created by an intervention relative to investment. Converts social outcomes into monetary equivalents.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Equity vs. Equality</strong></dt>
      <dd>Equity: distributing resources based on need to achieve equal outcomes. Equality: treating everyone the same regardless of circumstance. Key distinction in social policy.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Systems & Complexity</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Tragedy of the Commons</strong></dt>
      <dd>A situation where individual incentives lead to overexploitation of shared resources, resulting in collective harm. Example: overfishing in international waters.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Perverse Incentive</strong></dt>
      <dd>A policy or reward structure that unintentionally encourages outcomes contrary to the intended goal. Example: paying per paperclip produced incentivizing tiny, useless paperclips.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Emergence</strong></dt>
      <dd>Complex patterns and properties arising from relatively simple rules in a system. Individual behaviors combine to create unexpected system-level phenomena.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Path Dependence</strong></dt>
      <dd>The idea that history matters; where you end up depends on the path taken to get there, not just current conditions. Lock-in effects make change difficult.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Feedback Loop</strong></dt>
      <dd>A process where the output of a system influences its own input, either amplifying (positive feedback) or dampening (negative feedback) change.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Hysteresis</strong></dt>
      <dd>When a system's output depends on its history and not just current conditions. In economics, referring to unemployment staying elevated even after demand recovers.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Optimization vs. Satisficing</strong></dt>
      <dd>Optimization: seeking the absolute best solution. Satisficing: seeking a solution that's "good enough." Organizations often satisfice due to cognitive and information constraints.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Malthusian Trap</strong></dt>
      <dd>The hypothesis that population growth tends to exceed the growth in food supply, trapping societies in subsistence-level poverty. Proposed by Thomas Malthus in 1798. Historically falsified by technological progress and productivity improvements.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Bayesian Reasoning</strong></dt>
      <dd>A probabilistic framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B). Central to rational decision-making and scientific inference.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Cognitive Bias</strong></dt>
      <dd>Systematic patterns in how humans deviate from rational decision-making. Examples: confirmation bias (seeking confirming evidence), anchoring (over-weighting initial information), availability heuristic (overweighting readily available examples).</dd>

      <dt><strong>Base Rate Fallacy</strong></dt>
      <dd>The tendency to ignore the underlying probability of an outcome when making decisions. Example: A test is 99% accurate; if a person tests positive, the odds they actually have the disease depend heavily on disease prevalence, not the test accuracy alone.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Expected Value</strong></dt>
      <dd>The probability-weighted average outcome of a decision or gamble. EV = (Probability of outcome A × Value of A) + (Probability of outcome B × Value of B) + ... Rational actors should maximize expected value.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Epistemic Humility</strong></dt>
      <dd>Recognition of the limits of one's knowledge and the possibility of being wrong. The opposite of overconfidence; important for rational agents to acknowledge uncertainty.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Information Asymmetry</strong></dt>
      <dd>A situation where one party has more or better information than the other in a transaction. Can lead to adverse selection, moral hazard, and market failures.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Effective Altruism</strong></dt>
      <dd>A philosophical approach to doing good that uses reason and evidence to determine how to best help others. Emphasizes quantifying impact, considering long-term consequences, and prioritizing neglected problems.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Utility</strong></dt>
      <dd>A measure of satisfaction or well-being derived from consuming a good or service. Rational actors are assumed to maximize their utility, though preferences may be non-linear and subjective.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Ergodicity</strong></dt>
      <dd>In probability, a property where the time average of a process equals the ensemble average. In economics, relevant to whether past returns predict future returns and whether betting systems can be profitable over time.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Ludic Fallacy</strong></dt>
      <dd>The mistake of using games and probabilistic models to understand complex real-world situations that don't follow similar rules. Real-world "games" have unknown rules, payoffs, and players.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Philosophy & Epistemology</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Occam's Razor</strong></dt>
      <dd>Simpler explanations are generally preferable; don't multiply entities beyond necessity. A principle of parsimony: when two theories explain the same phenomenon equally well, choose the simpler one.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems</strong></dt>
      <dd>Any consistent formal system powerful enough to describe arithmetic cannot prove all true statements within that system. Implies fundamental limits to formal logic and mathematical proof; has profound implications for artificial intelligence and decidability.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Popper's Falsifiability</strong></dt>
      <dd>A theory is scientific if it's testable and disprovable. Science advances by falsifying hypotheses, not by proving them true. A theory that can't be falsified (in principle) is unfalsifiable and thus unscientific.</dd>

      <dt><strong>The Lindy Effect</strong></dt>
      <dd>The longer something has existed, the longer it's expected to survive. Non-perishable ideas, institutions, and technologies that have lasted centuries are likely to persist. Implies old things should be respected as they've survived selection pressure.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Antifragility vs. Robustness</strong></dt>
      <dd>Robustness resists shocks and stays the same. Antifragility benefits from volatility and disorder, improving through stress. Beyond merely avoiding harm, antifragile systems gain from challenges and uncertainty.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Type I vs. Type II Error</strong></dt>
      <dd>Type I: falsely rejecting a true hypothesis (false positive). Type II: falsely accepting a false hypothesis (false negative). The tradeoff between these errors shapes decision-making in medicine, law, and science.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Reflexivity</strong></dt>
      <dd>The idea that market prices influence the fundamentals they're supposed to reflect. Observer and observed interact; feedback loops between expectations and reality create historical paths. Markets are reflexive, not perfectly rational.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Veil of Ignorance</strong></dt>
      <dd>John Rawls' thought experiment: design a just society as if you don't know your position within it. Forces consideration of fairness from behind a "veil" of uncertainty about your own status and advantages.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Skin in the Game</strong></dt>
      <dd>Having personal financial or reputational stake in an outcome. Creates alignment of incentives between decision-maker and stakeholder. Lack of skin in the game is a major source of misaligned incentives and poor decisions.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Spontaneous Order</strong></dt>
      <dd>Complex social, economic, and political systems emerging from bottom-up individual decisions without central coordination. Markets, language, and traditions are examples of spontaneous order arising from decentralized action.</dd>

      <dt><strong>The Lindy Effect</strong></dt>
      <dd>The longer something has existed, the longer it's expected to survive. Non-perishable ideas, institutions, and technologies that have lasted centuries are likely to persist. Implies old things should be respected as they've survived selection pressure.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Goodhart's Law</strong></dt>
      <dd>"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Gaming metrics distorts underlying incentives. Optimizing for a proxy of what you care about often backfires when people adjust behavior in response.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Campbell's Law</strong></dt>
      <dd>The more a metric is used for decision-making, the more likely it will be corrupted. As institutions rely on metrics for accountability, the metrics themselves become targets, losing their validity.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Reversion to the Mean</strong></dt>
      <dd>Extreme outcomes tend toward the average over time. Unusually good or bad performance is often followed by more mediocre performance. An important corrective to overinterpreting short-term results.</dd>
