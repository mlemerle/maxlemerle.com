    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>
      Some questions I'm thinking about. Pointers to readings welcome.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Aristotle called politics "the highest science" because of its unique capacity to enable human flourishing. Why has it evolved into a domain of control rather than rigorous study of systems that promote wellbeing and virtue?</li>
      <li>What are the major lessons from Singapore's economic and social transformation? What combination of structures, policy, and institutional design enabled such rapid growth?</li>
      <li>Why does innovation thrive in certain ecosystems (Silicon Valley, Stockholm, Nairobi) and languish elsewhere? What are the emergent phenomena that characterize innovation hubs?</li>
      <li>How do we distinguish true value creation from rent-seeking? What would an economic system optimized for human flourishing actually look like?</li>
      <li>Where is the moral line for markets—especially in private prisons, childcare, healthcare? Are some human needs too fundamental to commodify?</li>
      <li>Why is virtuous leadership so rare? What prevents powerful individuals from cultivating and embodying virtue?</li>
      <li>Why does power tend to corrupt? Are there institutional designs that can preserve integrity in high-stakes roles?</li>
      <li>How does trust emerge at scale? What conditions enable or destroy it? What makes reputation systems work or fail?</li>
      <li>If progress = mass × energy × coordination, how do these interact across nations? Why do some societies advance faster than others?</li>
      <li>How do we maintain synthetic understanding across disciplines in an age of specialization?</li>
      <li>What makes "generous tit-for-tat" and cooperative strategies so robust? How do we design incentive structures that reward long-term cooperation?</li>
      <li>How do societies adapt to technological disruption? What structures help communities bounce back without technological lock-in?</li>
      <li>Is human life in equilibrium with Earth possible? What does sustainability actually look like with a growing population?</li>
      <li>How much of genius is innate vs. cultivated? How do nutrition, sleep, deliberate challenge, and stress shape cognitive capability?</li>
      <li>If material scarcity is eliminated, what provides meaning? How do we avoid hedonic collapse in a post-scarcity world?</li>
    </ul>
