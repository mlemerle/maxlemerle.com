    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>
      Some questions I'm thinking about. Pointers to readings welcome.
    </p>
    <ul>
  
      <li>(After reading Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs) What are the major lessons from Singapore's economic and social transformation? What combination of structures, policy, and institutional design enabled such rapid growth?</li>
      <li>(After reading Team of Rivals) What elements of Lincoln's personality and leadership contributed to his success in navigating the Civil War and preserving the Union? His storytelling ability? His optimism?</li>      
      <li>How do we best measure human flourishing? What metrics capture wellbeing beyond GDP? How can we embed these into the social & financial infrastructure?</li>
      <li>Why does innovation thrive in certain ecosystems (Silicon Valley, Stockholm, Nairobi) and languish elsewhere? What are the emergent phenomena that characterize innovation hubs?</li>
      <li>How do we distinguish true value creation from rent-seeking? What would an economic system optimized for human flourishing actually look like?</li>
      <li>Where is the moral line for markets (especially in private prisons, childcare, healthcare, etc.)? Are some human needs too fundamental to commodify?</li>
      <li>Why is virtuous leadership so rare? What prevents powerful individuals from cultivating and embodying virtue?</li>
      <li>Aristotle called politics "the highest science" because of its unique capacity to enable human flourishing. Why has it evolved into a domain of control rather than rigorous study of systems that promote wellbeing and virtue?</li>
      <li>Why does power tend to corrupt? Are there institutional designs that can preserve integrity in high-stakes roles?</li>
      <li>How does trust emerge at scale? What conditions enable or destroy it? What makes reputation systems work or fail?</li>
      <li>If progress = mass × energy × coordination, how do these interact across nations? Why do some societies advance faster than others?</li>
      <li>What makes "generous tit-for-tat" and cooperative strategies so robust in game theory iterative game simulations? How do we design incentive structures that reward long-term cooperation and automatically punish free-riders / exploiters?</li>
      <li>How do societies adapt to exponentially accelerating technological disruption?</li>
      <li>Is human life in equilibrium with Earth possible? What does sustainability actually look like a hundred years from now?</li>
      <li>How much of genius is innate vs. cultivated? How do nutrition, sleep, deliberate challenge, and stress shape cognitive capability?</li>
      <li>If material scarcity is eliminated, what provides meaning? How do we avoid hedonic collapse in a post-scarcity world?
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/is-it-a-bubble.pdf?sfvrsn=d4a92866_3">Howard Marks' "Is It a Bubble?"</a> memo discusses this to a degree in the postscript starting on page 16.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In a world where energy is increasingly becoming the de facto currency, what are the economic and geopolitical implications? Also, how do we solve and commercialise fusion?
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://singjupost.com/transcript-elon-musks-interview-on-people-by-wtf-w-nikhil-kamath/">Elon Musk & Nikhil Kamath interview transcript</a> explores this topic.</li>
        </ul>
