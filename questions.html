    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>
      Some questions I'm currently thinking about and trying to develop more sophisticated mental models and heuristics for:
    </p>

    <h2>Fundamental Reality: Physics, Consciousness & Cosmos</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Does the universe have a definitive beginning and end, or is it fundamentally cyclical in nature? Might it be better understood as a spatio-temporal object or tapestry, wherein the experience of "time's arrow" and forward progress is an illusion arising from the perspective of embedded observers?</li>
      <li>Did our universe perhaps originate from within a black hole, where accumulated mass eventually reaches a critical threshold and undergoes explosive expansion? If so, does this pattern recurse infinitely / is there always a universe one level up?</li>
      <li>What is the relationship between quantum uncertainty and determinism? If an external observer could locate every particle in the universe and compute its trajectory forward, what constraints would prevent perfect prediction?</li>
      <li>What is consciousness fundamentally? Is it substrate-dependent (requiring biological systems), or could it exist in artificial substrates? Can consciousness be measured, instantiated artificially, or transferred between substrates?</li>
      <li>If we inhabit a simulation, then by induction, the reality simulating us likely inhabits another simulation. How many layers of recursion might exist? What constitutes "base" reality, if such a thing is coherent?</li>
      <li>If simulations are possible, are we being simulated for some specific purpose or outcome (as in Liu's <em>Pantheon</em>)? Or are we more akin to a vast experimental garden designed to generate novel forms of consciousness or godhood (as in Weir's <em>The Egg</em> or technological singularity)?</li>
      <li>What is time phenomenologically? How does subjective experience of time differ from physical time? How does our perception of time change as we age?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Life, Growth, Progress & Sustainability</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the fundamental nature of life, and how do growth and progress emerge from physical law? What distinguishes living systems from non-living ones?</li>
      <li>Do humans create localized pockets of order and structure by their actions (Schrodinger)? Is this a fundamental counter-entropic drive, or does the resource consumption required to maintain such order inevitably generate greater entropy elsewhere?</li>
      <li>Do differences in compounding ability exacerbate over time, and if so, what are the implications for inequality and long-term stability?</li>
      <li>Is the global slowdown in reproduction rates a natural regulatory mechanism maintaining ecological equilibrium, or are we experiencing a soft Malthusian adjustment rather than a catastrophic trap?</li>
      <li>Is it possible for humanity to live in equilibrium with the Earth? What does such a future look like: solarpunk, matrix or something else entirely? Is true long-term sustainability achievable with a growing human population?</li>
      <li>How can societies ensure adequate renewal and novelty as life expectancy increases and mortality rates decline? Life and death have traditionally served as equilibrating mechanisms - what happens to institutional dynamism when certain classes achieve indefinite lifespan extension?</li>
      <li>What is the existential and philosophical significance of mortality? How does the awareness of death shape human urgency, meaning-making, and values?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Mind, Motivation, Learning & Human Excellence</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the fundamental nature of learning, and why does it seem to push the human mind toward greater heights? Why do universities, books, and deep reading appear universally associated with intellectual advancement and growth?</li>
      <li>How much of "genius" is innate versus cultivated? What is the relative contribution of nature versus nurture, and how do daily choices around nutrition, sleep, and rest interact with deliberate challenge, failure, and stress to shape cognitive capability?</li>
      <li>Where does drive and motivation fundamentally originate? What distinguishes those individuals who achieve at the highest levels and channel their ambition toward systemic change?</li>
      <li>How do we reconcile the concepts of free will and determinism? Do our choices reflect genuine agency, or are they the inevitable result of prior states and physical law?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Meaning, Spirituality & Human Nature</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Are there meaningful throughlines that connect the various spiritual and philosophical traditions across time and geography? What universal insights, if any, do they converge upon?</li>
      <li>Why do certain spiritual prophets resonate across cultures and centuries? Figures like Zarathustra, Jesus, Muhammad, Siddhartha Gautama, and others seem to tap into something fundamentally human and transcendent. When we resonate with their teachings, what truths about human nature are being illuminated?</li>
      <li>Following Girard's mimesis and Dawkins' memes, how do ideas spread, persist, and evolve? Are there universal patterns to cultural adoption and transformation? What makes certain ideas "sticky" across time and geography?</li>
      <li>If AI and automation eventually eliminate material scarcity, what provides meaning, purpose, and direction for human life? How do we avoid hedonic collapse and maintain engagement with existence in a post-scarcity world?</li>
      <li>What makes something beautiful? Is beauty objective, subjective, or something else entirely? What is the relationship between beauty and truth?</li>
      <li>Why do humans create art? What purpose does aesthetic experience serve in human flourishing and meaning-making?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Systems, Institutions & Human Flourishing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Aristotle called politics "the highest science" because of its unique capacity to enable human flourishing. Why has politics evolved into a domain of control and manipulation rather than a rigorous study of systems that best promote human wellbeing and virtue?</li>
      <li>Why is it relatively rare to encounter truly virtuous leaders and role models? What prevents individuals with power from cultivating and embodying virtue?</li>
      <li>Why does power tend to corrupt? Is this an inevitable consequence of human psychology and incentive structures, or are there institutional designs and practices that can preserve virtue and integrity in high-stakes leadership roles?</li>
      <li>What are the major lessons from Singapore's remarkable economic and social transformation over the past century? What particular combination of social structures, policy frameworks, and institutional design enabled such rapid and sustained growth?</li>
      <li>Why does innovation thrive in certain ecosystems and languish in others? Using network theory, geographic clustering, feedback loops, and power dynamics, what are the emergent phenomena that characterize innovation hubs? Why Silicon Valley, Stockholm, Nairobi and what structural friction inhibits innovation in other regions?</li>
      <li>How do we rigorously distinguish true value creation from rent-seeking and zero-sum wealth transfer? What would an economic system optimized for human flourishing look like? Where is the moral line for markets, especially in domains like private prisons, childcare, and healthcare?</li>
      <li>If progress can be understood as a function of mass (population), energy (motivation systems), and coordination (communication velocity), how do these factors interact in different national contexts? What explains differential rates of progress across societies?</li>
      <li>Given the explosion of specialization and disciplinary fragmentation, how do we maintain synthetic understanding across domains? What methods and institutions best enable the integration of knowledge from disparate fields?</li>
      <li>What is justice fundamentally? How do we balance individual rights, collective welfare, and procedural fairness?</li>
      <li>What makes a system or distribution fair? Are there objective principles of justice, or is fairness always culturally constructed?</li>
      <li>How does trust emerge in groups and societies? What are the conditions that enable or destroy trust at scale?</li>
      <li>What makes reputation systems work or fail? How does social capital compound or decay over time?</li>
      <li>How do societies adapt to technological change? What institutional and cultural structures help communities bounce back from disruption and avoid technological lock-in?</li>
      <li>What are the long-term second and third-order effects of transformative technologies? How can we develop wisdom about technological adoption?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Complexity, Dynamics & Emergence</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the role of feedback loops in the emergence of complex adaptive systems? How do negative feedback (homeostatic) and positive feedback (amplifying) mechanisms interact to create stability, oscillation, or catastrophic change?</li>
      <li>What makes "generous tit-for-tat" and other cooperative strategies so robust and evolutionarily successful? How can we design incentive structures that reward reciprocity and long-term cooperation over short-term defection?</li>
      <li>How do concepts from chaos theory (strange attractors, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, deterministic but unpredictable behavior) illuminate social and economic dynamics? Are there societal "strange attractors" that repeatedly draw systems toward particular equilibria?</li>
      <li>Is it possible to architect AI systems with symbiotic incentives baked into their foundational design, such that they develop alongside humanity rather than in an adversarial context? Can we transcend the competitive dynamics of capitalism and geopolitics?</li>
      <li>How did language emerge from pre-linguistic cognition? What are the origins of symbolic thought and abstract reasoning?</li>
      <li>What is the relationship between language and thought? Does language shape reality and perception, or merely describe an independent reality?</li>
